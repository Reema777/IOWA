# IOWA Case Competition Overview

## Context
-----
Gates Foundation primarily focuses on global health investing heavily in vaccines to prevent infectious diseases and support the development of integrated health solutions for family planning, nutrition, and maternal and child health. Global health has an allocation of investment dollars and the Foundation collaborates with grantee and partner organizations such as pharmaceutical companies to develop proposals that align with their strategic priorities and the organizationâ€™s focus.

## Problem Statement
-----
The crux of the case is to devise strategy in driving proper planning and resource allocations for the vaccine distribution across 74 GAVI classified countries. Understanding trends in global population and vaccination coverage are key to estimating health outcomes and to driving proper planning and resource allocations. Gates Foundation primarly uses population and health impact estimates to inform research and development (R&D) investment decisions in new tools such as vaccines. Gates Foundation typically prioritizes investments in vaccines with greater potential to avert cases of a given disease. Additionally, GAVI, The Vaccine Alliance, offers co-financing (where a country pays only part of the purchase price of a vaccine) to a select set of countries for many of the vaccines in our portfolio.
